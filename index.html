          Indoor navigation in complex buildings, such as hospitals and airports, has long been a technical challenge due to the limitations of GPS signals in enclosed environments. 
          Traditional positioning systems often rely on expensive hardware, complex configurations, and lack user-friendly interfaces. 
          In the 21st century, with the rapid advancement of wireless communication, artificial intelligence (AI), and augmented reality (AR) technologies, indoor positioning has entered a new era of innovation.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this work, we develop an AR-based indoor navigation system integrated with Wi-Fi positioning and AI algorithms to provide real-time and accurate indoor wayfinding services. 
          The system utilizes Wi-Fi fingerprinting enhanced by deep learning models (CNN) to achieve sub-meter positioning accuracy and transmits real-time location data to the Unity-based AR navigation platform through a Django RESTful API. 
          Users can visualize their navigation paths directly in the real-world environment via mobile devices

      <h2>WiFi Fingerprinting Localization</h2>
      <p>
        WiFi Fingerprinting is a widely used indoor positioning method, especially suitable for GPS-denied environments like hospitals and shopping malls. 
        It collects WiFi RSSI values at various locations to build a fingerprint database. 
        The user's real-time signal is matched against the database to estimate their position.
      </p>
      
      <p>
       In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to extract spatial features from RSSI data, achieving higher accuracy and robustness compared to traditional KNN methods. 
       The predicted location is sent via API to a Unity-based AR navigation system, enabling real-time path visualization and guidance.
