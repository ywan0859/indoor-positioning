          Indoor navigation in complex buildings, such as hospitals and airports, has long been a technical challenge due to the limitations of GPS signals in enclosed environments. 
          Traditional positioning systems often rely on expensive hardware, complex configurations, and lack user-friendly interfaces. 
          In the 21st century, with the rapid advancement of wireless communication, artificial intelligence (AI), and augmented reality (AR) technologies, indoor positioning has entered a new era of innovation.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this work, we develop an AR-based indoor navigation system integrated with Wi-Fi positioning and AI algorithms to provide real-time and accurate indoor wayfinding services. 
          The system utilizes Wi-Fi fingerprinting enhanced by deep learning models (CNN) to achieve sub-meter positioning accuracy and transmits real-time location data to the Unity-based AR navigation platform through a Django RESTful API. 
          Users can visualize their navigation paths directly in the real-world environment via mobile devices

      <h2>WiFi Fingerprinting Localization</h2>
      <p>
        WiFi Fingerprinting is a widely used indoor positioning method, especially suitable for GPS-denied environments like hospitals and shopping malls. 
        It collects WiFi RSSI values at various locations to build a fingerprint database. 
        The user's real-time signal is matched against the database to estimate their position.
      </p>
      
      <p>
       In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to extract spatial features from RSSI data, achieving higher accuracy and robustness compared to traditional KNN methods. 
       The predicted location is sent via API to a Unity-based AR navigation system, enabling real-time path visualization and guidance.

      <h2>Real-time AR Navigation</h2>
     <p>
      After accurately determining the user's position using WiFi fingerprinting and CNN models, our system transmits the location information to a Unity-based Augmented Reality (AR) mobile application via Django RESTful API.
      This application acts as a smart navigation interface, displaying virtual guides directly over the real-world environment.
     </p>

     <p>
      In the hospital scenario, the AR app overlays real-time navigation paths on the camera view of the user's smartphone. 
      Using Unity’s NavMesh and anchor system, it dynamically calculates the shortest path between the user’s current position and the desired destination such as a consultation room, pharmacy, or emergency area.
      Virtual arrows, lines, and labels are displayed on screen to guide the user intuitively through the complex indoor layout.
     </p>

     <p>
      Moreover, the system supports dynamic path updates based on the user’s movement. If the user deviates from the route, the navigation will automatically recalculate and provide a new path in real time.
      This enhances both efficiency and user experience, especially for first-time visitors, elderly patients, or emergency staff who require fast and reliable indoor guidance.
     </p>

     <p>
      This AR-based navigation platform significantly improves traditional indoor wayfinding methods by eliminating the need for paper maps, signs, or verbal instructions.
      It is particularly beneficial in large hospital environments where users may feel disoriented or stressed. By providing clear, visual, and interactive navigation, it enhances accessibility, reduces waiting times, and supports smarter healthcare operations.
